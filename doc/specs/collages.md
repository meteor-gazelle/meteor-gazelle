## Motivation

The collage system is an important feature.
It provides an orthogonal way to either artist page or tagging system to organise Album, based (mostly) on Facts.

## Business rules

* Collage could regroup artists, torrents, torrents group, requests, labels
* Collage should be subscribable
* Collage system should only permit the creation of a collage if:
  * the user is allowed to create collage,
  * the collage has enough torrents (today rules fix the min. number to 3)
* Collage system should inform users that:
 * a similar collage exist : so one can contribute to rather creating a new one
