## Motivation

In a world with pseudonyms and nonstatic avatars rather than names and static faces (not counting facial burn victims, who account for only a small percent of the population), it helps to have a system by which users can tag other users as "worthy of remembering" in some sense, as well as record written notes pertaining to another user (e.g., "sent me a scarf for Secret Santa 2012! cool dude")

## Business rules

* No information about User X's friend list, including the friend list as a whole as well as individual friend management actions taken by User X, shall be visible to anyone but User X him/herself.
* User X can have his/her access to the Friends system removed by staff (i.e., there is a staff-modifiable "Friends System Access" permissions flag on every user account.)
