## Motivation

The homepage is the initial landing page for all authenticated users. It provides users with a summary of site activity while enabling them to navigate to other areas of the site easily.

## Business rules.

The homepage is a collection of customizable sections. A section is a small block of content, limited in scope. The user may personalize their homepage by adding, removing, & re-ordering sections. Sections that would otherwise appear empty do not appear.

In addition, a "Site News" section appears at the top. It is used for critical announcements for the site. If the "Site News" section contains content, then the section appears at the top of the page & cannot be removed. Otherwise, the section does not appear.

Some examples of sections a user may want to add to their site might be:

* **Notifications**: A summary of the current user's notifications. Displays a maximum of five notifications at a time. Each notifications details may be expanded/collapsed. A user may hide the notification on this screen. Finally, the user may navigate to the notifications page.

* **Blog & Announcements**: The latest posts from the announcements forum.

* **Usage Statistics**: Graphical summary of a user's usage statistics, broken up by weeks, months, & years.

* **Album of the Week**: An album selected by a staff member. Displays album title, artist, year, & cover art. Links to album page.

* **Top Ten Albums**: List of the site's top ten albums, each linking to their respective album page. Data can be displayed for the past twenty-four hours, seven days, month, or year.
